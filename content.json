      "I'm Spiros, a Staff Motion Designer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, working at the intersection of product design, animation, and design systems. I use motion as a functional tool—to clarify interactions, reinforce hierarchy, and improve usability at scale.",
      "Currently working remotely at Qonto, I collaborate closely with product designers and engineers on product experiences and design systems. I focus on building reusable, well-documented motion patterns that teams can confidently use across complex products.",
      "Outside of work, I spend a lot of time cycling and hanging out with Finn, my Westie—who has strong opinions about walk schedules and absolutely none about motion design. I care deeply about craft, consistency, and pragmatism, and I believe great motion should feel invisible: intentional, purposeful, and grounded in real user needs."
