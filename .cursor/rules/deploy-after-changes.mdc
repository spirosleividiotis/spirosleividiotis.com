# Deploy After Changes

After making any code or content changes to this portfolio project:

1. **Stage** the changed files: `git add <files>` (or `git add -A` for everything).
2. **Commit** with a clear message: `git commit -m "Brief description of changes"`.
3. **Push** to deploy: `git push origin main`.

Do this automatically at the end of the task. Do not wait for the user to ask to deploy.

If the push is rejected (remote has new commits), pull with rebase first: `git pull --rebase origin main`, resolve any conflicts, then push again.

Do not skip deployment unless the user explicitly says not to deploy or only to make local changes.
