# Always Push Changes

**You must always push after making changes.** The user has requested that changes are always pushed. Do not finish a task that modified files without deploying.

After any code or content changes:

1. **Stage** the changed files: `git add <files>` (or `git add -A` for everything).
2. **Commit** with a clear message: `git commit -m "Brief description of changes"`.
3. **Push**: `git push origin main`.

Do this as part of the same task, right after your edits. Do not wait for the user to ask.

If push is rejected (remote has new commits): run `git pull --rebase origin main`, resolve any conflicts if needed, then `git push origin main` again.

Only skip if the user explicitly says "do not push" or "local changes only."
